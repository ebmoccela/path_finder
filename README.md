Path Finder is an automation tool to find paths of directories/files in linux server(s). It's a work in progress, but in the end it should automatically go through multiple servers. Currently that functionality is not there.

Things on the list to do:

    -get multiple servers path lookup working
  
    -make a GUI
  
    -possibly executible?
